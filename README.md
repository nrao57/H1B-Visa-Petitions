# H1B-Visa-Petitions-
Predicting whether an individual will be able to obtain an h1B Visa 

## Overview
H-1B visas allow U.S employers to employ foreign workers in highly technical occupations. However, not all applicants receive the immigration status and many are rejected during the certification process. 

Can we use machine learning and data analytics to predict who will be successfully granted an H-1B Visa? 

I will use both **Logistic Regression** and a **Deep Neural Network** developed in TensorFlow and compare the two methods and their respective accuracy.

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa)
